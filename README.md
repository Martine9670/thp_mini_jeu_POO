### 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to "THEY ALL WANT MY OOP", a small text-based fighting game developed in Ruby using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
The goal? Be the last survivor by battling multiple enemies!

This project is a series of practical exercises designed to help you master Object-Oriented Programming in Ruby by creating a simple but fun game.

Understand how to structure your code using classes and objects.

🔁 Manage interactions between objects through methods
Players, enemies, and combat logic all communicate via methods.

🕹️ Implement an interactive game loop in the console
Let the player make choices, trigger actions, and control the game's flow.
